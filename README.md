#MadrasKitchen#
Madras Kitchen is an Android native application I build as a final project for Udacity's Android developer Nanodegree course. 
The source has been removed as I am planning to publish it on Playstore.
This Project gets data from a json feed and populates the SQLite3 database.
Main features of this app are:
- View Veg & Non-veg recipes.
- Designed for phones & tablets and is compatible with all screen sizes.
- User can set a favourite recipe.
- User can search for a recipe based on the ingredients or search criteria.
